A good rule of thumb for judging whether your solution is appropriately \"robust\" is to ask yourself \"If I added additional observations or variables to this data set, or if the order of variables changed, would my code still compute the right solution?\"\n",

    "**2.** Building on what you did in class with the `diamonds` dataset, create four separate graphics that each tells a story about the relationship between `carat`, `clarity`, `cut` and `color` on the `price` of a diamond. You may use ggplot2, MatPlotLib, or SeaBorn to write the code. Use component-based design principles, including annotations, to generate graphics that reveal what you think is the most important aspect of each relationship. Take advantage of color, transparency, faceting, or other features if you think it helps to reveal a relationship! Finally, write a 1 sentence description that summarizes each relationship. "
